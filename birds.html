        <p>The Wood Stork is the only stork native to North America, mainly  in wetlands, swamps, and sometimes found around public parks/ponds. You will usally see them either wadding in the water looking for fish, crabs, bugs, or frogs to swallow up. Or you may find them roosting high up in a tree somewhere around its nest. Wood Storks used to be considered endangered from the 80s to 2014, They have made an incredible recovery moving their status to of Least Concern and taking back areas they once left due to population decrease. The Wood Stork knows what you did. It judges you. Pray you never make eye contact. </p>

        <h3>Brown Thrasher</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>

        <p>The Brown Thraher is a songbird related to the Mockingbird, and is relatively large compared to other thrashers. This little baby ahs the largest repitoire of songs of any song bird with it being able to sing up to 2000 different songs. For its size it is remarkably elusive, often never being seen in the open usally staying inside wooded areas or just on the egde of it. And yes, Brown Thrashers do thrash. When they find a prime spot on the ground for food they will bash their curved beak int the ground, almost like a dirt woodpecker, over an dover again till they get what they are searching for. Did you just hear a noise outside? You did. Its the Brown Thrasher. They're coming for you. You wont even know when it happens. </p>
